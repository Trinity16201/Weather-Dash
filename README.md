# Weather-Dash

My motivation for this project was to have a better understanding of the use of APIs in conjunction with everything I've learned so far in the course. This was one of the more challenging assignments to date and it took a lot longer to completed that I originally anticipated. There are a lot of different functionalities encapsulated within this assignment and I used as many resources as possible including TA's, my teacher, my tutors, a friend in the industry, some of my peers, and the learning assistants in slack. I did enjoy the sheer amount of items I learned from this including a better understanding of APIs, functions using items from APIs, and for loops.
